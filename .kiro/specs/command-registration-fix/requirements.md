# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Baseline Lens extension is experiencing a command registration error during development testing where the command 'baseline-lens.openDocumentation' is being registered multiple times, causing activation failures. This issue prevents proper extension testing and development workflow. The solution needs to implement robust command registration that prevents duplicate registrations and handles extension reloading gracefully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer testing the Baseline Lens extension, I want the extension to activate successfully without command registration conflicts, so that I can test functionality in development mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated multiple times THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate command registrations
2. WHEN a command is already registered THEN the system SHALL handle the conflict gracefully without throwing errors
3. WHEN the extension is reloaded during development THEN the system SHALL clean up previous registrations before creating new ones
4. WHEN activation fails due to command conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust command registration management, so that the extension works reliably across different VS Code environments and development scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering commands THEN the system SHALL check for existing registrations before attempting to register
2. WHEN disposing the extension THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all registered commands
3. WHEN the extension context is provided THEN the system SHALL use proper subscription management for all commands
4. WHEN command registration fails THEN the system SHALL continue with partial functionality rather than complete failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle development scenarios gracefully, so that I can iterate quickly without manual cleanup steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL detect and handle hot reloading scenarios
2. WHEN the extension is deactivated THEN the system SHALL ensure all resources are properly disposed
3. WHEN reactivating after deactivation THEN the system SHALL start with a clean state
4. WHEN multiple instances might exist THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts between them
