# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Baseline Lens is a VS Code extension that integrates Baseline compatibility data directly into the development workflow. It detects usage of modern web features (CSS, JS, HTML) and provides inline support status indicators, helping developers make informed decisions about feature adoption without context-switching to external resources. The extension serves as a trust layer for modern web development, similar to how ESLint provides code quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to see real-time compatibility status for web features I'm using, so that I can make informed decisions about browser support without leaving my IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write CSS, JavaScript, or HTML code THEN the system SHALL detect modern web features and display inline compatibility indicators
2. WHEN a feature is widely available THEN the system SHALL display a âœ… indicator
3. WHEN a feature is newly available THEN the system SHALL display a âš  indicator  
4. WHEN a feature has limited support THEN the system SHALL display a ðŸš« indicator
5. WHEN I hover over a compatibility indicator THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with browser/version breakdown and MDN links

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed diagnostic information about compatibility issues, so that I can understand and address potential browser support problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compatibility issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings/errors in the VS Code Problems panel
2. WHEN I view a diagnostic entry THEN the system SHALL provide quick links to documentation, polyfills, or fallbacks
3. WHEN multiple features have compatibility issues THEN the system SHALL organize diagnostics by severity and feature type
4. WHEN I click on a diagnostic THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant code location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tech lead, I want to generate project-wide compatibility reports, so that I can assess overall browser support and enforce team standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute the "Generate Baseline Report" command THEN the system SHALL scan all project files for web features
2. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL output results in JSON or Markdown format
3. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL include a summary of features used and their compatibility statuses
4. WHEN viewing the report THEN the system SHALL categorize features by support level (widely available, newly available, limited)
5. WHEN the report identifies risky features THEN the system SHALL highlight them for review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working in a CI/CD environment, I want to integrate compatibility checking into my build pipeline, so that unsafe features don't reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure CI/CD integration THEN the system SHALL provide exportable configuration for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other pipelines
2. WHEN unsafe features are detected in CI THEN the system SHALL fail the build with detailed error messages
3. WHEN the build fails due to compatibility issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback on how to resolve the issues
4. WHEN compatibility standards change THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of acceptable support thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer learning new web features, I want smart suggestions and alternatives, so that I can use modern features safely or find appropriate fallbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a risky feature is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest safer alternatives or fallback approaches
2. WHEN I request suggestions for a specific feature THEN the system SHALL provide code snippets for polyfills or alternative implementations
3. WHEN a feature has known compatibility issues THEN the system SHALL offer educational context about why it's problematic
4. WHEN I'm using a newly available feature THEN the system SHALL explain the feature's purpose and current support status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work seamlessly across different web technologies, so that I get consistent compatibility checking regardless of my project setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with CSS files THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze CSS features using PostCSS
2. WHEN I work with JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze JS features using appropriate AST parsing
3. WHEN I work with HTML files THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze HTML features
4. WHEN I work in React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte projects THEN the system SHALL correctly identify web features within component templates and styles
5. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL use the latest web-features dataset for compatibility information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to be lightweight and non-disruptive, so that it enhances my workflow without impacting performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL run locally without requiring external API calls
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL complete parsing and analysis within 100ms for typical file sizes
3. WHEN displaying indicators THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's native Diagnostic and Decoration APIs
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN the system SHALL load the web-features dataset efficiently without blocking the IDE
5. WHEN working on large projects THEN the system SHALL analyze files incrementally to maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a team member, I want consistent compatibility standards across my team, so that we maintain uniform browser support policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team standards are configured THEN the system SHALL allow customization of support thresholds (e.g., only show warnings for features with <90% support)
2. WHEN a project has specific browser requirements THEN the system SHALL respect custom browser support matrices
3. WHEN team settings are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes across all team members' environments
4. WHEN onboarding new team members THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on project-specific compatibility standards
