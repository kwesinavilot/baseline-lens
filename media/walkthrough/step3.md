# Problems Panel Integration

The VS Code Problems panel shows all compatibility issues found in your project, making it easy to review and address potential browser support problems.

## What you'll see:

### Issue Categories:
- **Errors**: Features with very limited support that could break your site
- **Warnings**: Features that work but have compatibility concerns  
- **Info**: Educational notes about feature usage

### Issue Details:
Each problem entry includes:
- **Feature name**: What web feature was detected
- **File location**: Exact line and column where it's used
- **Compatibility status**: Current baseline status
- **Quick actions**: Links to docs, alternatives, or fixes

## Navigation:
- **Click any issue** to jump directly to that line in your code
- **Use keyboard shortcuts** to navigate between issues
- **Filter by severity** to focus on the most critical problems

## Pro Tips:
- Keep the Problems panel open while coding for real-time feedback
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+M` (Mac) to quickly open it
- Right-click issues for additional context menu options
